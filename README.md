# NEIJI_CHESS_ENGINE
I plan to use this engine to play against stockfish online and shredder online. Both on hardest level.

Current esquisse : ln(x).ln(x) on middle game from a starting pattern and so on next time (replace the pattern later) or signal processing (this one will be hard to implmenet). Must certainly use NN (it seems there is no way but that now).

Although I'm a former BJJ practicer who stopped sport because of lack of time, I think that the ln'x).ln(x) function and patterns can be used in BJJ for the side control position. I'm a previous member of chekmate team france but I'm not sure. On the other hand, side control was the better position I mastered even witth titled fighters. Now I'm 40 yo. Then, I can't really fight. Plus, I can't see the futur of MMA. I hope that I didn't choke anybody.
about what I said because I needed more practice.
