# NEIJI_CHESS_ENGINE
I plan to use this engine to play against stockfish online and shredder online. Both on hardest level.

Current esquisse : ln(x).ln(x) on middle game from a starting pattern and so on next time (replace the pattern later) or signal processing (this one will be hard to implmenet). Must certainly use NN (it seems there is no way but that now).
